                        <p>TSA (Technology Student Association) is a national organization dedicated to helping students create a better future in the Mathematics and Technology fields. The organization uses its yearly set of competitions to test the abilities of the students competing in the event. As well as proving their expansive knowledge, the members are able to represent their school and community when competing for 1st place. </p>
                        <p>The TSA motto “Learning to lead in a technical world” is precisely what the organization is working towards, as the club has opened branches in 48 of the 50 states. The overall mission of TSA is to have the members of the club learn and develop their skills in the STEM department and to eventually implement them on solutions towards the world’s concerning international problems.</p>

The officers of the club observed the impact of TSA on the surrounding communities, and decided to bring the opportunity to the students of West Windsor and Plainsboro.
                        </p>
                        <p class = "text-white">Despite the lengthy process of getting the club approved in the school, the officers stayed persistent and were able to establish the club in school before the September of 2017. The club was founded with enough time to publicly introduce the club at the school club fair, in which students from the school get a glimpse of the club’s mission and are able to directly join the club. Currently the club has recruited 66 loyal members, and plans to expand by next year.</p>

                                <p>Before the start of every club meeting, each student must sign in via google form. Occasionally, the officers send google forms through email to help understand the progress of each group by asking them to fill out a progress survey. Afterwards, the officers each drop in each group to check on how much they have done, and what they plan for the next week. The officers will advise each group as they move closer to the competition dates.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    To keep all students in tact with their TSA event, the club runs weekly meetings to regroup the teams and update each other on any group progress. The club officers begin the meetings with recaps on competition dates, lab safety training sessions, and general announcements. Throughout the meetings, students in each event regroup to share their personal progress on the project, as well as to collaborate on plans for the upcoming competitions.

                                <p>Club fair is a school program in which each club has a chance to showcase the main message of the club, and can directly recruit members by recording their names and contact information. The TSA club of High School North was able to gain 66 loyal members through that short fair, and hopefully will be able to expand on that number by next year’s fair.

                                <p> The lab safety training is a TSA school club program that teaches each student the different technology available to them. Once they finish the lesson, they have 3 chances to pass a quiz on the lab information. The quiz is to ensure that everyone who goes into the lab room, has enough experience and knowledge to keep themselves injury free before the end of the season. If the student passes the quiz, they will have extensive use to all the lab’s materials and if necessary, has the help of Mr. Ianneli, the teacher advisor the the club.

                                <h4>Guest Speakers</h4>
                                <p>In order to inspire the students and provide a real life example, the president of the club asked for a couple guests to speak to the club’s members. The guests were the school’s robotics team, who have won state competitions through hard work and determination. The purpose of the lesson was to explain the importance of developing your abilities in the STEM fields, thus preparing students with enough knowledge to compete for career opportunities that contain skills that you have previously used in TSA.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Party</h4>
                                <p> As work stricken as the weeks may be, the club ensures to decrease the amount of stress on the students. The students took part in a small party at one of the meetings before the groups started the implementation of their projects. The party became a quick success as all the members of the club had brought different items to contribute to the party, and were able to enjoy themselves and each other's company.

                                <h4>Project Code</h4>
                                <p>One way in which TSA becomes a bigger part of the community is how it reaches its members out to different areas to provide inspiration of the club, and to implement the mission of TSA. In Project Code, an organization dedicated to providing children with a chance to get a head start on the basics of computer languages. The TSA club president and a couple of the members have dedicated multiple hours to promote Project Code in Monroe, and Hamilton.

                                <h4>Innovation Fair</h4>
                                <p> 
                                    Another way the TSA club helps to promote the TSA motto is by encouraging its own school members to compete in local events. The Innovation Fair in West Windsor-Plainsboro is a public community fair where students from different schools, and ideas come to display their potentially innovative projects. By having our members work towards this fair, the club is able to promote technological advancements in the STEM fields, while also advocating for TSA’s mission.

The officers of our club went with curiosity, as a school new to TSA, yet came back with confidence in the club’s goals and members. The meeting helped each school learn more about TSA’s overall mission and gave information more specific to each competition and how to prepare the club for these exclusive events. Additionally, guest speakers and alumni with successful backgrounds gave their opinion and advice to the officers about how to manage the club, and why competing in these events are crucial to the community. Also, being able to see the officers of other more experienced schools gave insight to the officers of what the club may evolve into with time and success.
