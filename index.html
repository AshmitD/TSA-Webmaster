                        <p>TSA (Technology Student Association) is a national organization dedicated to helping students create a better future in the Mathematics and Technology fields. The organization uses its yearly set of competitions to test the abilities of the students competing in the event. In addition to expanding their knowledge, the members are able to represent their school and community when competing. </p>
                        <p>The TSA motto “Learning to lead in a technical world” is precisely what the organization is working towards, as the club has opened branches in 48 of the 50 states. The overall mission of TSA is to have the members of the club learn and develop their skills in the STEM department and to eventually implement them on solutions towards the world’s concerning international problems.</p>

                        <p class = "text-white">Despite the lengthy process of getting the club approved in the school, the officers stayed persistent and were able to establish the club in school before the September of 2017. The club was founded with enough time to publicly introduce the club at the school club fair, where recruited 66 loyal members were recruited. The chapter is collectively participating in 19 competitive events for the first time at the NJ state conference this spring. </p>

                                <p>Before the start of every club meeting, each student must sign in to attendance via Google Form. Once a month, the officers send a checkpoint form through email to check up on the progress of each group. The weekly after school meeting following this checkpoint, the officers meet with each group in person to check in on their progress, answer questions, and help them plan for the next week. The officers will advise each group as they move closer to the competition dates.
                                </p>

                                    To keep all students in tact with their TSA event, the club runs weekly meetings to regroup the teams and update each other on any group progress. The club officers begin the meetings with recaps on competition dates, event updates, and general announcements. Throughout the meetings, students in each event regroup to share their personal progress on the project, as well as to collaborate on plans for the upcoming competitions.

The TSA club of High School North was able to gain 66 loyal members through that short fair and hopefully, will be able to expand on that number by next year’s fair.

                                <p> The lab safety training is a TSA school club program that teaches each student the different technology available to them. Once they finish the lesson, they have 3 chances to pass a quiz on the lab information. The quiz is to ensure that everyone who goes into the lab room has enough experience and knowledge to ensure their own safety and the safety of those around them. If the student passes the quiz, they will have access to all the lab’s machinary.
                                </p>

                                <p>To inspire the students and expose them to other applications of technology, the President of the chapter asked for a few guests to speak at one of the weekly meetings. The guests were a self initiated FIRST FTC robotics team and their mentor, who demoed their robot and spoke about their programming design.

                                <p> To celebrate New Years, the students held a party at one of the weekly meetings in January. The party became a quick success as all the members of the club had brought different food items to contribute. Students shared their projects with other groups, enjoying themselves and each other's company.

                                <p>Project Code is a community program founded by 3 members of our TSA chapter to provide elementary school kids access to free programming classes. Members of our TSA chapter created a 3 month long Scratch programming curriculum, contacted libraries, and promoted the classes to the community. So far, the team has taught 60 students in 2 local libraries - Hamilton and Monroe.
                                </p>

                                <p> 
                                    Another way the TSA club helps to promote the TSA motto is by encouraging its own school members to showcase their TSA projects in the community. The Innovation Fair in West Windsor-Plainsboro is a public community fair where students from different schools come to display their innovative projects. Members of our TSA chapter have been accepted to showcase their projects at this fair this spring.

The officers of our club went with curiosity, as a school new to TSA, yet came back with confidence in the club’s goals and members. Each of the officers learned valuable leadership skills interacting with the state officers and other TSA chapters. The officers also participated in a Toy Story themed design challenge, where they had to create a carriage that moved past a zipline.
